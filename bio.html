        <h2>âœ¨ About Me</h2>
        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hey there â€” Iâ€™m Nathan Able, a software developer whoâ€™s just as passionate about writing clean code as I am about creating meaningful digital experiences. My journey into tech started in logistics, where I worked at Amazon developing internal software that optimized receiving systems, tracked global productivity, and automated core operations. I saw firsthand how the right tools, built with care and precision, could solve real problems at scale â€” and I was hooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ§  But for me, development isnâ€™t just about systems and syntax. Itâ€™s about people. Iâ€™m also a parent, and one of my sons is autistic. Watching him explore and interact with the digital world gave me a new perspective on what technology should be â€” not just fast or impressive, but intuitive, inclusive, and empowering. His journey reshaped mine. It inspired me to shift from building tools for speed to building tools for understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ’¡ Today, Iâ€™m diving deeper into web development, UI design, and accessibility â€” creating apps and interactive experiences that are clear, supportive, and fun to use. Iâ€™ve worked on everything from booking platforms to educational game prototypes, and I bring a strong mix of frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and backend logic (Python, Flask, SQLite) to every project. I also love using AI tools like GitHub Copilot to ideate faster and push creative boundaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸŽ® One of my current goals is developing games that blend storytelling with skill-building â€” especially for children with learning differences. Itâ€™s still early, but I'm excited to explore how serious games and playful design can support real growth, both academically and socially.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ›  Whether Iâ€™m debugging an edge case or wireframing a new feature, I approach each task with curiosity, clarity, and a sense of purpose. I donâ€™t just want to build things that work â€” I want to build things that help.
        </p>
        <p>
          ðŸ“« If you're working on something that blends tech, creativity, and inclusion â€” or you just want to talk about thoughtful software development â€” Iâ€™d love to connect. Letâ€™s build tools that make a difference.
