    Formerly a logistics software innovator at Amazon, I spent years developing tools that improved efficiency and accuracy at scale. But it was my journey as a parent of an autistic child that shifted my focus. Now, I’m channeling that same development skill set into building accessible web tools and educational games—projects that are not only technically sound but designed with empathy, clarity, and real-world impact in mind. My goal is to create technology that empowers and includes, especially for those who experience the world differently.
